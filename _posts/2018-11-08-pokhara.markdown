The first week in Pokhara, I mostly took it easy, flying locally from Sarangkot, the local takeoff. I was either going up with the tandem bus, or by hiking. Not very interesting flying (stable!), with restrictions (can't fly before 10am nor after 4pm because of the airport), but very good food :)

Here are some pictures:
